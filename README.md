## Description
Inside this repo you find the project used for [this medium article](https://shiggins95.medium.com/create-a-smooth-segmented-text-input-in-react-native-30a2cd06f8c7).
It is a basic demonstration app for a segmented text input.

### Running the app

#### Step 1: Start metro

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

#### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
